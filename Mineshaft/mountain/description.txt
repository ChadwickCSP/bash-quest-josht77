top of mountain

You have reached the top of the mountain after a long hike. There appears 
to be a ladder that leads down into a dark hole where you cannot see 
the bottom. You do not have a source of light so it would be risky to 
go down the ladder. You see some food and water off to the side of the 
ladder. You can [take] the resources because it may be useful for your
journey. Or, you can go [down] the ladder into the darkness, 
or walk back down the [path] of the mountain.
