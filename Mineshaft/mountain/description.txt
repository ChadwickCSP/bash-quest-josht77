top of mountain

You have reached the top of the mountain after a long hike. There appears 
to be a ladder that leads down into a dark hole where you cannot see 
the bottom. You do not have a source of light so it would be risky to 
go down the ladder. You can either go [down] the ladder into the darkness, 
or walk back down the [path] of the mountain.
